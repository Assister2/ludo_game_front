                  1. Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act, 1867 provides that
                  games of mere skill are exempt from the application of the
                  Act. The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts in
                  India have opined that a game of mere skill is a game “in
                  which, although the element of chance necessarily cannot be
                  entirely eliminated, success depends principally upon the
                  superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and
                  adroitness of the player. A game of skill is one in which the
                  element of skill predominates over the element of chance.” No
                  penalty can be imposed upon a person for playing such games of
                  skill.

                  2. Users must note that ‘Ludo’ game available for challenge in
                  our platform is ‘Games of Skill’, under Indian law, and that
                  we does not support, endorse or offer to Users ‘games of
                  chance’ for money. While ‘Games of Skill’ do not have a
                  comprehensive definition, they are those games where the
                  impact of a player’s effort and skill on the outcome of a game
                  is higher than the impact of luck and chance.

                  3. It may be noted that States are permitted, by the Indian
                  Constitution, to enact laws regulating betting and gambling in
                  their respective jurisdictions. In furtherance of these
                  powers, various States have enacted anti- gambling
                  legislations. Such legislations are largely in concert with
                  the Public Gambling Act of 1867 (and include the exception of
                  “games of skill”). Where a State legislation on gambling
                  exists, it prevails over the Public Gambling Act of 1867. In
                  this regard, the Assam Game and Betting Act, 1970 and Orissa
                  (Prevention of) Gambling Act, 1955 and Telangana State Gaming
                  (Amendment) Ordinance and High Court Judgment in Gujarat, 2017
                  prohibits games with money stakes and also does not create an
                  exception for games of skill. Therefore, currently, residents
                  of Assam, Odisha, Telangana and Gujarat are not permitted to
                  play on our site.

                  overcome using his/her skills and knowledge of the game.
                  Elements of luck are present in every game to add thrill and
                  excitement, but no two attempts at a game are identical so
                  Users must use their skills in order to be successful
